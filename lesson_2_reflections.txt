Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1: I guess Git starts to recognize the files in the repository and prepare itself to track the changes in the files.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A2: I think in staging area we cannot edit files but it is just a snapshot of added files. I think what it offers is to take a snapshot that will be committed later.

===========================================================================================

Q3: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A3: I think by adding only those files that are related to the change

===========================================================================================

Q4: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A4: It would be helpful when we want to change the files but we are not sure the changes work properly.

Q5: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A5: By showing the connection path between commits

===========================================================================================

Q6: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A6: A series of commits consisted of commits of merged branches
    To know that there used to be a branch

===========================================================================================

Q7: What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

A7: prons: it does not make mistake in taking into account all versions of a code
	   it shows the conflicting parts of codes automatically
    cons: nothing
